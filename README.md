TF Gamejam 2023

Walking sim in a castle (on a lake)? cursed items that tf you, have to figure out how to break the curse, end up with reusable tf items.
Birds fly down from the top to deliver messages, goal is to figure out who's sending them.

tf forms:
anteater for fishing with tongue
cow for udder milking
messenger bird for egg laying/shooting

Different parts of the castle could be for different forms then
Maybe the general idea is that you pick something up to enter a part of the castle and then get TFed
Before changing back when you place said object in the right spot
Pick up the crystal statue and play through a segment as a mouse before finding the next pedestal etc etc
lock you to the new form the first time you're in the new area, then when its finished, let you use your other tf items

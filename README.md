TF Gamejam 2023

Walking sim in a castle (on a lake)? cursed items that tf you, have to figure out how to break the curse, end up with reusable tf items.
Birds fly down from the top to deliver messages, goal is to figure out who's sending them.

tf forms: still have some armor pieces. Never explain why all the forms are female
human armored knight base form - can't do much
anteater for fishing with tongue, reaching keys down tubes/drains, claw attack, slow movement
cow for udder milking/charge attack/pushing heavy things
emu/cassowary for egg laying/shooting & fast running - egg target shooting/physics based destruction

Different parts of the castle could be for different forms then
Maybe the general idea is that you pick something up to enter a part of the castle and then get TFed
Before changing back when you place said object in the right spot
Pick up the crystal statue and play through a segment as a mouse before finding the next pedestal etc etc
lock you to the new form the first time you're in the new area, then when its finished, let you use your other tf items
